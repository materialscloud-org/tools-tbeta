# TBETA (Tight-Binding Electronic Transport Application) for graphene nanoribbon junctions

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KrisCer/Transport_app/master?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FTight-Binding%20Electronic%20Transport%20Application.ipynb)

<b>TBETA</b> gives you a simple graphical interface that lets you design a two-terminal Graphene nanoribbon (GNR) junction with a 60°, 120° or 180°, angle between the leads. Afterwards calculate its transport and electronic properties based on nearest-neighbour tight-binding model. Conductance is expressed within Landauer formalism and calculated using Green's function methods.

Current version: 1.1.0

## Usage

To design the junction structure:<br>
1)Select the desired junction angle, width of GNR leads and three additional parameters called distance, shift and chirality.<br>
2)Atoms can be removed from the initial scattering region by entering the corresponding atom number(s) and then pressing the 'Remove atoms' button<br>
3)Initial structure template with no atoms removed can be reset by pressing 'Reset system'<br><br>
The electronic structure and transport properties are calculated:<br>
1)Conductance and density of states (DOS) are calculated in a selected energy range by adjusting the 'min' and 'max' energy values and pressing the Calculate button<br>
2)Local density of states, local current map and wavefunctions in the lead channels are displayed for a selected single energy value defined in terms of the tight-binding hopping integral t<br>
